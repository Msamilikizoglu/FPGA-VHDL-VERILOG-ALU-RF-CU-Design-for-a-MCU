# FPGA-VHDL-VERILOG-ALU-RF-CU Design-for a MCU
There are two different projects written different hardware description languages.

##  FPGA-VHDL-16-bit-ALU-and-Register-File-Design

The purpose of this project is to design a Register File (RF) and a 16-bit Arithmetic and
Logic Unit (ALU) for a microprocessor. This ALU will be used in the datapath of the
microprocessor, and must support signed 2â€™s complement arithmetic and all the arithmetic and
logic instructions in the baseline architecture. 

More details are included in the file as "About_Project.pdf" 

"Xilinx ISE Project Files.rar" is actually whole files of the ise project

##  FPGA-VERILOG-8-bit-ALU-CU-and-RF-Design

More details are included in the files such as "ALU Design.pdf", "RB Design.pdf" and "TOP Design.pdf".

Project Report is included as "Project Report.pdf" in turkish language.
